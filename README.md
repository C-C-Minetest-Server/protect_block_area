# Protector Blocks for Area Protection Mod
This mod provide a block that works like the one in [Protector Redo](https://content.minetest.net/packages/TenPlus1/protector/), but create areas based on the [Area Protection Mod](https://content.minetest.net/packages/ShadowNinja/areas/) instead.

Therefore, players who don't know how to use the commands provided by the Area Protection Mod can now use the protector block to do the same job, without installing two protection mods.
